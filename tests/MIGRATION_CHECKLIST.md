# Test Migration Checklist

This document provides a detailed checklist for migrating each test file from unittest to pytest style, following SOLID principles and project best practices.

## Migration Process Overview

1. **Initial Conversion**: Use `migrate_test.py` to convert unittest.TestCase to pytest functions
2. **Dependency Injection**: Replace patching with proper dependency injection
3. **Use Centralized Fixtures**: Leverage fixtures from conftest.py and expected_data.py
4. **Verify Coverage**: Ensure the migrated tests maintain the same coverage
5. **Documentation**: Update documentation and mark old files as deprecated

## Priority 1: High-Impact Files

### `tests/unit/test_skype_parser.py` → `test_skype_parser_pytest.py`

#### Initial Setup
- [x] Run initial migration with migrate_test.py
- [x] Review generated file for correctness

#### Code Refactoring
- [x] Replace unittest assertions with pytest assertions
- [x] Replace patches with fixture injection
- [x] Use typed fixtures from conftest.py
- [x] Use expected_data.py for centralized expectations
- [x] Apply Single Responsibility Principle to test organization

#### Verification
- [x] Run tests to ensure they pass
- [x] Verify coverage with verify_test_migration.py
- [x] Check for any regressions or edge cases

#### Documentation
- [x] Update MIGRATION_TRACKER.md
- [x] Mark old file as deprecated
- [x] Add docstrings to new test functions

### `tests/unit/test_content_extractor.py` → `test_content_extractor_pytest.py`

#### Initial Setup
- [x] Run initial migration with migrate_test.py
- [x] Review generated file for correctness

#### Code Refactoring
- [x] Replace patches with mock implementations from fixtures/mocks
- [x] Implement dependency injection pattern
- [x] Use typed fixtures for improved readability
- [x] Apply Interface Segregation Principle to test dependencies

#### Verification
- [x] Run tests to ensure they pass
- [x] Verify coverage with verify_test_migration.py
- [x] Check for any regressions or edge cases

#### Documentation
- [x] Update MIGRATION_TRACKER.md
- [x] Mark old file as deprecated
- [x] Add docstrings to new test functions

## Priority 2: Integration Tests

### `tests/integration/test_etl_pipeline_integration.py` → `test_etl_pipeline_integration_pytest.py`

#### Initial Setup
- [x] Run initial migration with migrate_test.py
- [x] Review generated file for correctness
- [x] Mark original file as deprecated

#### Identified Challenges
- [x] TestableETLPipeline is deprecated, need to use ImprovedTestableETLPipeline
- [x] Validation patching is not working correctly due to validation chain
- [x] API mismatch between expected and actual pipeline methods

#### Code Refactoring
- [x] Replace TestableETLPipeline with ImprovedTestableETLPipeline
- [x] Create proper mock implementations for validation functions
- [x] Implement comprehensive patching strategy for validation chain
- [x] Replace hardcoded expectations with centralized ones
- [x] Use factory patterns for test data
- [x] Implement proper dependency injection
- [x] Apply Open/Closed Principle to test fixtures

#### Verification
- [x] Run tests to ensure they pass
- [x] Verify coverage with verify_test_migration.py
- [x] Check for any regressions or edge cases

#### Documentation
- [x] Update MIGRATION_TRACKER.md
- [x] Update MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md
- [x] Add docstrings to new test functions

## Priority 3: Utility Tests

### `tests/unit/test_structured_logging.py` → `test_structured_logging_pytest.py`

#### Initial Setup
- [x] Run initial migration with migrate_test.py
- [x] Review generated file for correctness

#### Code Refactoring
- [x] Replace unittest assertions with pytest assertions
- [x] Create proper fixtures for context and logging
- [x] Fix issues with decorated test functions
- [x] Apply Dependency Inversion Principle to test dependencies

#### Verification
- [x] Run tests to ensure they pass
- [x] Check for any regressions or edge cases

#### Documentation
- [x] Update MIGRATION_TRACKER.md
- [x] Mark old file as deprecated
- [x] Add docstrings to new test functions

## Cleanup Phase

### Deprecated Files Removal
- [x] Verify all migrated tests pass with pytest
- [x] Remove `tests/unit/test_etl_pipeline.py` after verifying its replacement works
- [x] Remove `tests/unit/test_etl_transformer.py` after verifying its replacement works
- [x] Move needed code from `tests/mocks.py` to fixtures/mocks directory
- [x] Move needed code from `tests/factories.py` to fixtures
- [x] Remove `scripts/test_centralized_logging.py`
- [x] Move needed code from `tests/helpers.py` to test_helpers.py (Note: helpers.py not found in tests directory)

### Final Verification
- [x] Run full test suite with coverage
- [x] Generate final migration report
- [x] Update documentation with lessons learned and best practices
