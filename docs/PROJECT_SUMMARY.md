# SkypeParser Project Summary

## Overview

SkypeParser is a Python tool for parsing, analyzing, and storing Skype export data. It provides a comprehensive solution for extracting data from Skype export files (TAR or JSON), transforming it into a structured format, and loading it into a PostgreSQL database for analysis and reporting.

## Key Features

- **Parsing**: Extract data from Skype export files in JSON or TAR format
- **ETL Pipeline**: Process data through a modular Extract-Transform-Load pipeline
- **Database Storage**: Store both raw and transformed data in PostgreSQL
- **Memory Efficiency**: Handle large exports with streaming processing
- **Message Type Handling**: Support for various message types (text, media, polls, calls, etc.)
- **Attachment Handling**: Download, organize, and extract metadata from attachments
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze message patterns, frequencies, and content
- **Visualization**: Generate visualizations of chat activity
- **API Access**: Access functionality through a REST API
- **Dependency Injection**: Modular architecture with dependency injection for testability

## Architecture

The SkypeParser project is organized into several modules:

### Core Modules

- **Parser Module**: Core parsing functionality for Skype export files
- **Database Module**: Database interaction and ETL pipeline
- **Utilities Module**: Utility functions, helpers, and the dependency injection framework
- **Analysis Module**: Data analysis and visualization tools

### Additional Modules

- **API Module**: REST API for accessing and processing Skype data
- **Validation Module**: Data validation and schema verification
- **Logging Module**: Structured logging and error handling
- **Monitoring Module**: Performance monitoring and resource tracking
- **Messages Module**: Message type handling and processing
- **Files Module**: File handling and I/O operations
- **Conversations Module**: Conversation processing and analysis
- **Data Handlers Module**: Specialized data handlers for different content types

## ETL Pipeline

The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline is a core component of the SkypeParser project. It provides a structured way to process Skype export data:

1. **Extraction**: Reading and validating data from Skype export files
2. **Transformation**: Cleaning and structuring the raw data
3. **Loading**: Storing both raw and transformed data in PostgreSQL

The pipeline has been refactored into a modular architecture with the following components:

- **ETLContext**: Manages state and configuration across ETL components
- **Extractor**: Handles file reading and validation
- **Transformer**: Processes raw data into structured format
- **Loader**: Manages database operations
- **ETLPipeline**: Orchestrates the ETL process

## Dependency Injection Framework

The project uses a lightweight dependency injection framework to improve testability and maintainability:

- **Protocol-based interfaces** for all major components
- **Service provider** for registering and resolving dependencies
- **Support for singleton, transient, and factory services**
- **Constructor injection** for clean, testable code

## Message Type Handling

The project supports a wide range of message types, including:

- Text messages
- Media messages (images, videos, audio)
- Poll messages
- Call events
- Scheduled call invitations
- Location messages
- Contact messages

Each message type has specialized handling to extract structured data.

## Database Schema

The database schema includes tables for storing both raw and transformed data:

- **skype_raw_exports**: Stores the raw export data
- **skype_conversations**: Stores transformed conversation metadata
- **skype_messages**: Stores transformed messages
- **skype_attachments**: Stores attachment metadata
- **skype_users**: Stores user information

## Testing Framework

The project includes comprehensive test suites using both unittest and pytest:

- **Unit tests** for individual components
- **Integration tests** for component interactions
- **End-to-end tests** for complete workflows
- **Factory-based test data generation** for consistent test data
- **Mock objects** for isolating components during testing

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into the following sections:

- **Getting Started**: Quick start guides for installation and basic usage
- **User Guide**: Comprehensive documentation for end users
- **Developer Guide**: Documentation for developers contributing to the project
- **Implementation**: Details on specific implementation aspects

## Project Status

The project is actively maintained and developed. Recent improvements include:

- Refactoring the ETL pipeline into a modular architecture
- Implementing enhanced message type handling
- Adding support for attachment handling
- Improving memory efficiency for large exports
- Implementing a dependency injection framework
- Enhancing the testing framework with factory-based test data generation

## Next Steps

Planned improvements for the project include:

- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Enhanced web interface for data visualization
- Improved error handling and recovery
- Support for additional database backends
- Enhanced API functionality
- Improved documentation and examples
