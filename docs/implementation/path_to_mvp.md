# Skype Parser Implementation Plan

Based on my analysis of the codebase, I'll outline a structured implementation plan to get a working MVP while ensuring proper dependency injection. This plan breaks down the work into logical phases with clear deliverables for each step.

## Phase 1: Configuration and Basic Setup (1-2 days)

### 1.1: Environment Configuration
- [x] Create `config/config.json` from the example file
- [x] Set up PostgreSQL database with appropriate credentials (using Supabase)
- [x] Create virtual environment and install dependencies from requirements.txt
- [x] Verify basic imports work without errors (fixed circular dependency issues)

### 1.2: Basic Structural Testing
- [x] Run existing unit tests to identify any immediate issues (found and fixed DI test issues)
- [x] Create a minimal test file that instantiates key components
- [x] Verify DI service registration works with core components (fixed DI tests)

**Deliverable**: Working development environment with validated configuration âœ…

## Phase 2: Core ETL Pipeline Validation (2-3 days)

### 2.1: Extractor Component
- [x] Test extractor with a small sample Skype export
- [x] Ensure file handling works for both JSON and TAR formats
- [x] Verify DI integration for content extraction
- [x] Organize tests in the proper tests/integration directory

### 2.2: Transformer Component
- [x] Test transformer with sample extracted data
- [x] Verify message type handlers resolve correctly
- [x] Process different message types (text, media, etc.)
- [x] Organize tests in the proper tests/integration directory

### 2.3: Loader Component
- [x] Validate database schema creation
- [x] Test data loading with transformed data
- [x] Manage database connections properly
- [x] Organize tests in the proper tests/integration directory

### 2.4: Additional Test Organization
- [x] Move database connection tests to integration tests directory
- [x] Move ETL component tests to integration tests directory
- [x] Move import tests to unit tests directory
- [x] Ensure all tests are in their proper directories
- [x] Organize utility scripts into a dedicated scripts directory
- [x] Organize documentation files into a structured docs directory
- [x] Remove duplicate markdown files from root directory

**Note**: Loader component testing implemented with a custom DatabaseConnectionAdapter to bridge interface differences. Further refinement needed to address schema namespace issues.

**Deliverable**: Validated ETL components working independently with proper DI

## Phase 3: Integration and MVP Creation (3-4 days)

### 3.1: Pipeline Integration
- [x] Create a simple CLI wrapper script for the ETL pipeline
- [x] Test the full ETL pipeline with a small real dataset
- [ ] Implement basic error handling and reporting

**Note**: The CLI wrapper script has been created and tested with a small real dataset. The extraction phase works correctly, but there are issues with the transformer (message type handlers) and loader (missing required keys). These issues need to be addressed in the DI Framework Refinements phase.

### 3.2: DI Framework Refinements
- [ ] Review message handler registration process
- [ ] Ensure singleton vs. transient services are correctly configured
- [ ] Add any missing protocol definitions for components

### 3.3: MVP Documentation
- [ ] Create a simple user guide for the MVP
- [ ] Document configuration options and requirements
- [ ] Add examples for common usage scenarios

**Deliverable**: Working end-to-end MVP with documentation

## Phase 4: Testing and Refinement (2-3 days)

### 4.1: Unit Testing
- [ ] Create/update unit tests for all key components
- [ ] Ensure DI-specific tests validate service resolution
- [ ] Test edge cases for message handling

### 4.2: Integration Testing
- [ ] Create integration tests for the full pipeline
- [ ] Test with various Skype export formats and sizes
- [ ] Validate database schema and data integrity

### 4.3: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Test parallel processing functionality
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for large datasets
- [ ] Implement and test checkpointing for resumable operations

**Deliverable**: Fully tested, optimized MVP with performance validation

## Phase 5: Advanced Features (Optional, 3-4 days)

### 5.1: Extended Message Type Support
- [ ] Implement handlers for additional message types
- [ ] Add support for attachments and media
- [ ] Enhance content extraction capabilities

### 5.2: Analysis and Reporting
- [ ] Implement basic reporting functionality
- [ ] Add data visualization options
- [ ] Create example queries for common analytics

### 5.3: User Interface Improvements
- [ ] Enhance CLI with additional options
- [ ] Add progress reporting and status updates
- [ ] Implement logging improvements

**Deliverable**: Enhanced MVP with advanced features

## Implementation Approach

### Technical Focus Areas

1. **Dependency Injection**:
   - Use constructor injection consistently
   - Leverage protocol-based interfaces for all components
   - Register services through the service registry

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement comprehensive error checking and validation
   - Provide clear error messages with context
   - Ensure clean recovery from common errors

3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Test each component in isolation with mock dependencies
   - Verify end-to-end functionality with integration tests
   - Include performance tests for large datasets

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Database Connectivity**:
   - Implement connection retries and pool management
   - Provide clear error messages for database issues
   - Add configuration validation

2. **Memory Management**:
   - Test with progressively larger datasets
   - Implement and verify garbage collection triggers
   - Monitor memory usage with the existing tools

3. **Parallel Processing**:
   - Start with single-threaded processing for simplicity
   - Add parallel processing as an optional enhancement
   - Test thread safety of shared components

## Getting Started

To begin implementation, I recommend:

1. Start with the configuration and setup phase
2. Create a small sample Skype export for testing
3. Focus on getting the basic ETL pipeline working
4. Add refinements and optimizations incrementally
