# Skype Parser Implementation Plan

Based on my analysis of the codebase, I'll outline a structured implementation plan to get a working MVP while ensuring proper dependency injection. This plan breaks down the work into logical phases with clear deliverables for each step.

## Phase 1: Configuration and Basic Setup (1-2 days)

### 1.1: Environment Configuration
- [x] Create `config/config.json` from the example file
- [x] Set up PostgreSQL database with appropriate credentials (using Supabase)
- [x] Create virtual environment and install dependencies from requirements.txt
- [x] Verify basic imports work without errors (fixed circular dependency issues)

### 1.2: Basic Structural Testing
- [x] Run existing unit tests to identify any immediate issues (found and fixed DI test issues)
- [x] Create a minimal test file that instantiates key components
- [x] Verify DI service registration works with core components (fixed DI tests)

**Deliverable**: Working development environment with validated configuration ✅

## Phase 2: Core ETL Pipeline Validation (2-3 days)

### 2.1: Extractor Component
- [x] Test extractor with a small sample Skype export
- [x] Ensure file handling works for both JSON and TAR formats
- [x] Verify DI integration for content extraction
- [x] Organize tests in the proper tests/integration directory

### 2.2: Transformer Component
- [x] Test transformer with sample extracted data
- [x] Verify message type handlers resolve correctly
- [x] Process different message types (text, media, etc.)
- [x] Organize tests in the proper tests/integration directory

### 2.3: Loader Component
- [x] Validate database schema creation
- [x] Test data loading with transformed data
- [x] Manage database connections properly
- [x] Organize tests in the proper tests/integration directory

### 2.4: Additional Test Organization
- [x] Move database connection tests to integration tests directory
- [x] Move ETL component tests to integration tests directory
- [x] Move import tests to unit tests directory
- [x] Ensure all tests are in their proper directories
- [x] Organize utility scripts into a dedicated scripts directory
- [x] Organize documentation files into a structured docs directory
- [x] Remove duplicate markdown files from root directory

**Note**: Loader component testing implemented with a custom DatabaseConnectionAdapter to bridge interface differences. Further refinement needed to address schema namespace issues.

**Deliverable**: Validated ETL components working independently with proper DI

## Phase 3: Integration and MVP Creation (3-4 days)

### 3.1: Pipeline Integration
- [x] Create a simple CLI wrapper script for the ETL pipeline
- [x] Test the full ETL pipeline with a small real dataset
- [x] Implement basic error handling and reporting

**Progress Note**: Enhanced the error handling in the ETL pipeline by implementing a comprehensive error reporting system. The pipeline now generates detailed error reports that include the error type, message, traceback, phase, timestamp, and relevant context information. It also creates checkpoints for potential resumption when errors occur, making it easier to recover from failures.

### 3.2: DI Framework and Interface Standardization
- [x] Review and standardize interface definitions in `src/utils/interfaces.py`
- [x] Fix method name mismatches between interfaces and implementations
- [x] Implement missing methods in `ContentExtractor` class (e.g., `extract_cleaned_content`)
- [x] Add `execute` method to `DatabaseConnection` class that calls `execute_query`
- [x] Update database batch operations to use appropriate methods for PostgreSQL
- [x] Correct message handler factory registration in service registry
- [x] Implement proper context initialization for required attributes like `user_id` and `export_date`
- [x] Ensure singleton vs. transient services are correctly configured

**Progress Note**: Implemented several key fixes to address interface-implementation mismatches and ensure proper initialization of required attributes. The `execute` method was added to the `DatabaseConnection` class, the `extract_content` and `extract_html_content` methods were implemented in the `ContentExtractor` class, the message handler factory registration was corrected in the service registry, and the ETL context initialization was updated to ensure `user_id` always has a default value. The loader was also updated to use the `execute_batch` method of the database connection for batch operations. After reviewing the dependency injection framework, we confirmed that singleton vs. transient services are correctly configured, with ETL components and the ETL context registered as singletons, which is appropriate for their usage.

### 3.3: MVP Documentation
- [x] Create a simple user guide for the MVP
- [x] Document configuration options and requirements
- [x] Add examples for common usage scenarios

**Progress Note**: Created comprehensive documentation for the MVP, including a user guide (docs/user_guide/README.md) that provides an overview of the tool, its features, prerequisites, installation instructions, and basic usage. Also documented configuration options in detail (docs/user_guide/CONFIGURATION.md) and added examples of common usage scenarios (docs/user_guide/USAGE_EXAMPLES.md) to help users get started with the tool.

**Deliverable**: Working end-to-end MVP with documentation ✅

## Phase 4: Testing and Refinement (2-3 days)

### 4.1: Unit Testing Enhancement
- [x] Update unit tests for ETL components to verify fixed interfaces
- [x] Add tests for the added methods in `ContentExtractor`
- [x] Create tests for database connection methods and batch operations
- [x] Ensure DI-specific tests validate service resolution
- [x] Test proper context initialization and attribute handling
- [x] Test edge cases for message handling
- [x] Update test documentation to reflect new tests and approaches

**Progress Note**: Enhanced unit tests by adding comprehensive tests for the newly implemented methods in the ContentExtractor class (`extract_content` and `extract_html_content`) and created a new test file for the DatabaseConnection class with specific tests for the `execute` method and other database operations. Added tests for edge cases in message handling to ensure robustness against unexpected input. Created a new test file for DI-specific service resolution with ETL components to validate that the dependency injection framework correctly resolves services. Added tests for proper context initialization and attribute handling, specifically focusing on the `user_id` and `export_date` attributes. Updated all test README files to reflect the new tests and approaches. These tests ensure that the interface implementations are working correctly and help maintain code quality as the project evolves.

### 4.2: Integration Testing
- [x] Update integration tests to verify end-to-end pipeline functionality
- [x] Test with various Skype export formats and sizes
- [x] Validate database schema and data integrity
- [x] Create specific tests for error handling and recovery

**Progress Note**: Enhanced integration testing by creating comprehensive test files for error handling and recovery, various export formats and sizes, and database schema and data integrity. Created `test_error_handling_recovery.py` to test checkpoint creation and resumption after errors, including tests for multiple error recovery and checkpoint data integrity. Added `test_export_formats.py` to test processing different Skype export formats (JSON, TAR) and various data sizes, including large datasets and mixed message types. Created `test_db_schema_integrity.py` to validate the database schema and ensure data integrity, including tests for referential integrity, data types, constraints, and incremental data loading.

### 4.3: Performance Optimization
- [x] Test parallel processing functionality
- [x] Optimize memory usage for large datasets
- [x] Implement and test checkpointing for resumable operations
