## ETL Pipeline Implementation

The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline is a core component of the SkypeParser project. It provides a structured way to process Skype export data:

1. **Extraction**: Reading and validating data from Skype export files
2. **Transformation**: Cleaning and structuring the raw data
3. **Loading**: Storing both raw and transformed data in PostgreSQL

The pipeline has been refactored into a modular architecture with the following components:

- **ETLContext**: Manages state and configuration across ETL components
- **Extractor**: Handles file reading and validation
- **Transformer**: Processes raw data into structured format
- **Loader**: Manages database operations
- **ETLPipeline**: Orchestrates the ETL process

For more details, see [ETL Pipeline](etl-pipeline.md).

## Validation Implementation

Data validation is an important aspect of the SkypeParser project. The validation system ensures that:

- Input data is valid and well-formed
- Transformed data meets the expected schema
- Database operations maintain data integrity

For more details, see [Validation](validation.md).

## Loader Optimization

The loader component of the ETL pipeline has been optimized for performance:

- Bulk insertion for improved performance
- Connection pooling for efficient database connections
- Batched operations for reduced memory usage
- Transaction management for data integrity

For more details, see [Loader Optimization](loader-optimization.md).

## Logging Implementation

The logging system provides structured logging with context:

- Log context for providing context for log messages
- Log levels for different types of messages
- Log formatting for easy parsing
- Log routing for directing logs to appropriate destinations

For more details, see [Logging](logging.md).

## Refactoring and Improvements

The SkypeParser project has undergone significant refactoring to improve maintainability, testability, and performance:

- Modularization of the codebase
- Implementation of dependency injection
- Improved error handling
- Enhanced testing framework
- Performance optimizations

For more details, see [Refactoring](refactoring.md).
