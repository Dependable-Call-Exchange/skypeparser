## Overview

This document outlines a staged approach to improving the SkypeParser codebase, addressing identified issues while minimizing disruption to ongoing development. The plan focuses on enhancing testability, maintainability, and reliability through incremental improvements.

## Current State Assessment

The SkypeParser codebase currently exhibits several issues:

1. **API Inconsistency**: Mismatches between expected parameter types and actual usage (e.g., `ETLContext.end_phase()` expecting a dictionary but receiving a string)
2. **Testing Infrastructure Weaknesses**: Mock objects created as patches rather than usable functions
3. **Inconsistent Dependency Injection**: Varying approaches to DI across components
4. **Error Handling Inconsistencies**: Lack of standardized error handling patterns
5. **Complex Test Utilities**: `TestableETLPipeline` attempting to handle too many scenarios
6. **Low Test Coverage**: Only 17% of the codebase is covered by tests

## Implementation Details

### Stage 1: MockTransformer Fix

```python
def transform(self, raw_data: Dict[str, Any], user_display_name: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Transform raw Skype export data into a structured format.

    Args:
        raw_data: Raw Skype export data
        user_display_name: Optional display name of the user

    Returns:
        Transformed data
    """
    if self.context:

    logger.debug(f"Transforming data with context: {self.context}")

    # ... existing implementation ...

    if self.context:
        # Pass a dictionary result to end_phase, not a string
        self.context.end_phase({
            'status': 'completed',
            'phase': 'transform',
            'conversations_processed': total_conversations,
            'messages_processed': total_messages
        })

    return transformed_data
```

### Stage 2: Improved Mock Environment

```python
def create_mock_file_environment(file_data: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> Dict[str, Callable]:
    """
    Create a set of ready-to-use mock functions for file operations.

    Args:
        file_data: Dictionary mapping file paths to their data

    Returns:
        Dict[str, Callable]: Dictionary of mock functions (not patches)
    """
    # Use factories to create default test data if not provided
    if file_data is None:
        file_data = {
            "test.json": SkypeDataFactory.build(),
            "complex.json": SkypeDataFactory.build(
                conversations=[
                    SkypeConversationFactory.build(with_message_count=5),
                    SkypeConversationFactory.build(with_message_count=3)
                ]
            ),

            ),
            "test.tar": SkypeDataFactory.build()
        }

    file_reader = MockFileReader()
    for path, data in file_data.items():
        file_reader.add_file(path, data)

    # Create validation service
    validation_service = MockValidationService(file_data)

    # Create actual mock functions (not patches)
    mock_functions = {

        "path_isfile": lambda path: True,
        "access": lambda path, mode: True,
    }

    return mock_functions
```

### Stage 3: Improved ETLContext Phase API

```python
class ETLPhase:
    """Context manager for ETL phases."""

    def __init__(self, context, phase_name):
        self.context = context
        self.phase_name = phase_name
        self.result = {}

    def __enter__(self):
        self.context.start_phase(self.phase_name)
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        if exc_type is not None:
            self.context.record_error(self.phase_name, str(exc_val))
            return False

        self.context.end_phase(self.result)
        return True

    def set_result(self, result):
        """Set the result for this phase."""
        self.result = result

# Usage example:
def transform(self, raw_data, user_display_name=None):
    with ETLPhase(self.context, 'transform') as phase:
        # Perform transformation
        result = self._perform_transformation(raw_data, user_display_name)

        # Set phase result
        phase.set_result({
            'status': 'completed',
            'conversations_processed': len(result['conversations']),
            'messages_processed': sum(len(c.get('messages', [])) for c in result['conversations'])
        })

        return result
```
