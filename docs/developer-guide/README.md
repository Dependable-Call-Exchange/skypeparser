# SkypeParser Developer Guide

Welcome to the SkypeParser Developer Guide. This comprehensive resource is designed for developers who want to understand, contribute to, or extend the SkypeParser project.

## Introduction

SkypeParser is a Python tool for parsing, analyzing, and storing Skype export data. The project emphasizes:

- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns with distinct, focused components
- **Extensibility**: Well-defined interfaces that make extending functionality straightforward
- **Testability**: Dependency injection and other practices that enable thorough testing
- **Maintainability**: Clean, documented code following SOLID principles

This guide will walk you through the architecture, core components, design patterns, development workflow, and extension points of the SkypeParser project.

## Architecture and Design

### High-Level Architecture

SkypeParser follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns. The system is organized into several modules, each with specific responsibilities:

```
SkypeParser
├── Parser Module
│   ├── Core Parser
│   ├── Content Extractor
│   └── File Output
├── Database Module
│   ├── ETL Pipeline
│   │   ├── Extractor
│   │   ├── Transformer
│   │   └── Loader
│   ├── Database Connection
│   └── Schema Manager
├── Utilities Module
│   ├── Dependency Injection
│   ├── Error Handling
│   ├── Logging
│   └── File Handling
└── Analysis Module
    ├── Queries
    ├── Reporting
    └── Visualization
```

For a deeper dive into the architecture, see [Architecture](architecture.md).

### Modular Design Approach

The project is organized into distinct modules with clear responsibilities. This modular approach offers several advantages:

- Each module can be developed, tested, and maintained independently
- Modules interact through well-defined interfaces
- New functionality can be added without modifying existing code
- Components can be reused across different parts of the application

Learn more about our modularization strategy in [Modularization](modularization.md).

### SOLID Principles

SkypeParser adheres to SOLID principles throughout its codebase:

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Components are open for extension but closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Subtypes can replace their base types
- **Interface Segregation Principle**: Clients aren't forced to depend on interfaces they don't use
- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules

For details on how these principles are applied, see [SOLID Principles](solid-principles.md).

## Core Components

### Parser Module

The Parser Module extracts data from Skype export files and includes:

- **Core Parser**: Parses Skype export files (JSON or TAR) and extracts conversations, messages, and metadata
- **Content Extractor**: Processes message content, handling different message types
- **File Output**: Exports parsed data to various formats

### Database Module and ETL Pipeline

The Database Module manages database interactions and implements the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline:

- **ETL Pipeline**: Orchestrates the data processing workflow
  - **Extractor**: Reads and validates data from input sources
  - **Transformer**: Converts raw data into a structured format
  - **Loader**: Persists data to the database
- **Database Connection**: Manages database connectivity
- **Schema Manager**: Handles database schema creation and updates

The ETL pipeline is discussed in detail in [ETL Context API](etl-context-api.md).

### Utilities Module

The Utilities Module provides shared functionality across the project:

- **Dependency Injection**: Lightweight DI framework for managing component dependencies
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling and reporting
- **Logging**: Structured logging with context
- **File Handling**: File operations and I/O utilities

### Analysis Module

The Analysis Module provides tools for analyzing and visualizing Skype data:

- **Queries**: Predefined queries for common analysis tasks
- **Reporting**: Report generation tools
- **Visualization**: Data visualization components

## Design Patterns and Best Practices

### Dependency Injection

SkypeParser uses a lightweight dependency injection framework to improve testability and maintainability:

```python
from src.utils.di import get_service
from src.utils.interfaces import FileHandlerProtocol
from src.utils.service_registry import register_all_services

# Register all services
register_all_services(db_config=db_config)

# Get a service by its protocol
file_handler = get_service(FileHandlerProtocol)

# Use the service
data = file_handler.read_file("path/to/file.json")
```

This approach decouples components and makes them easier to test. For a complete guide to our DI implementation, see [Dependency Injection](dependency-injection.md).

### Factory Pattern

The project uses the factory pattern for creating objects with complex initialization requirements:

```python
from src.db.etl.pipeline_factory import PipelineFactory

# Create a pipeline factory
factory = PipelineFactory()

# Create a pipeline
pipeline = factory.create_pipeline(
    db_config=db_config,
    output_dir=output_dir,
    parallel_processing=True
)
```

Learn more about our factory implementations in [Factory Pattern](factory-pattern.md).

### Error Handling

SkypeParser implements a centralized error handling system that:

- Provides consistent error reporting across the application
- Includes contextual information for better debugging
- Logs errors with appropriate severity levels
- Implements recovery mechanisms where appropriate

For guidelines on error handling, see [Error Handling](error-handling.md).

### Documentation Standards

All code in SkypeParser should be documented following these guidelines:

- All modules, classes, and functions should have docstrings
- Docstrings should include parameter descriptions and return values
- Complex algorithms should include explanatory comments
- Examples should be provided for non-trivial functionality

## Development Environment Setup

To set up a development environment for SkypeParser:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/skype-parser.git
   cd skype-parser
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

4. Install pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Development Workflow

# Run pylint
pylint src tests

# Run flake8
flake8 src tests
```
