# Checkpoint Resumption in the ETL Pipeline

This document describes the checkpoint resumption functionality in the ETL pipeline, which allows for resuming failed ETL operations from the last successful phase.

## Overview

The ETL pipeline processes data in three distinct phases:

1. **Extract**: Extracts raw data from Skype export files
2. **Transform**: Transforms raw data into a structured format
3. **Load**: Loads transformed data into the database

Each phase can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially for large datasets. If a failure occurs during any phase, the checkpoint resumption functionality allows you to resume the pipeline from the last successful phase, avoiding the need to restart the entire process.

## How Checkpoints Work

The checkpoint functionality is built on the following components:

1. **ETLContext**: Maintains state across ETL components and provides methods for creating and managing checkpoints
2. **ETLPipeline**: Orchestrates the ETL process and provides methods for saving and loading checkpoints

After each phase of the ETL process, a checkpoint can be created that captures:

- The current state of the ETL process
- References to extracted and transformed data
- Progress metrics and telemetry
- Configuration settings

These checkpoints can be saved to disk as JSON files, allowing the pipeline to be resumed even after the application has been restarted.

## Using Checkpoint Resumption

### Creating Checkpoints

Checkpoints are automatically created at the end of each phase in the ETL pipeline. You can also manually create a checkpoint at any time using the `save_checkpoint` method:

```python
# Create and run the pipeline
pipeline = ETLPipeline(db_config=db_config, output_dir='output')
results = pipeline.run_pipeline(file_path='skype_export.tar')

# Save a checkpoint
checkpoint_file = pipeline.save_checkpoint()
print(f"Checkpoint saved to: {checkpoint_file}")
```

### Resuming from a Checkpoint

To resume from a checkpoint, you can use the `load_from_checkpoint` class method to create a new pipeline instance from a checkpoint file, and then run the pipeline with the `resume_from_checkpoint` flag:

```python
# Load the pipeline from a checkpoint
pipeline = ETLPipeline.load_from_checkpoint('output/etl_checkpoint_123.json')

# Resume the pipeline
results = pipeline.run_pipeline(
    file_path='skype_export.tar',
    resume_from_checkpoint=True
)
```

### Example Script

The `examples/checkpoint_resumption_example.py` script demonstrates how to use the checkpoint resumption functionality. It includes:

1. Running the ETL pipeline with checkpoints after each phase
2. Simulating a failure during a specific phase
3. Resuming the pipeline from the last checkpoint

To run the example:

```bash
# Run with a simulated failure in the transform phase
python examples/checkpoint_resumption_example.py -f skype_export.tar --fail-phase transform

# Resume from the checkpoint
python examples/checkpoint_resumption_example.py -f skype_export.tar --resume --checkpoint-file output/etl_checkpoint_*.json
```

## Implementation Details

### ETLContext Checkpoint Methods

The `ETLContext` class provides the following methods for checkpoint management:

- `serialize_checkpoint()`: Serializes the context state to a dictionary
- `restore_from_checkpoint(checkpoint_data)`: Restores a context from serialized checkpoint data
- `save_checkpoint_to_file(checkpoint_dir)`: Saves the context state to a checkpoint file
- `load_from_checkpoint_file(checkpoint_file)`: Loads a context from a checkpoint file

### ETLPipeline Checkpoint Methods

The `ETLPipeline` class provides the following methods for checkpoint management:

- `save_checkpoint(checkpoint_dir)`: Saves the current context state to a checkpoint file
- `load_from_checkpoint(checkpoint_file, db_config)`: Creates a new pipeline instance from a checkpoint file
- `get_available_checkpoints()`: Returns a list of available checkpoint phases
- `run_pipeline(resume_from_checkpoint=True)`: Runs the pipeline, optionally resuming from the latest checkpoint

## Best Practices

1. **Always specify an output directory**: Checkpoints require an output directory to save data files
2. **Use unique task IDs**: If running multiple ETL processes, use unique task IDs to avoid checkpoint conflicts
3. **Handle database connections carefully**: When resuming, ensure database credentials are still valid
4. **Test resumption scenarios**: Test different failure scenarios to ensure resumption works correctly
5. **Monitor disk space**: Checkpoints can consume significant disk space for large datasets

## Limitations

1. **Memory constraints**: Very large datasets might not fit in memory when resuming
2. **External dependencies**: Changes to external systems (e.g., database schema) between runs might cause issues
3. **File dependencies**: The original input file must still be available when resuming
4. **Partial phase resumption**: Currently, resumption only works at phase boundaries, not within phases

## Future Enhancements

1. **Incremental checkpoints**: Support for creating checkpoints within phases
2. **Checkpoint compression**: Compress checkpoint data to reduce disk usage
3. **Checkpoint cleanup**: Automatically clean up old checkpoints
4. **Distributed processing**: Support for checkpoints in distributed processing environments
5. **Checkpoint validation**: Validate checkpoints before resuming to ensure consistency
