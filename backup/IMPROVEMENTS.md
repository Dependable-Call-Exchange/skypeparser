## Configuration Management

### Improvements
- Created a centralized configuration system in `src/utils/config.py`
- Added support for loading configuration from environment variables and JSON files
- Implemented deep merging of configuration from different sources
- Added utility functions for extracting specific configuration sections
- Created a sample configuration file at `config/config.json.example`
- Moved hardcoded message types to configuration files
- Created a dedicated message types configuration file at `config/message_types.json`
- Added a utility function to get message type descriptions from configuration
- Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`

### Benefits
