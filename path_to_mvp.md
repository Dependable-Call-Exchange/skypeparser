# Skype Parser Implementation Plan

Based on my analysis of the codebase, I'll outline a structured implementation plan to get a working MVP while ensuring proper dependency injection. This plan breaks down the work into logical phases with clear deliverables for each step.

## Phase 1: Configuration and Basic Setup (1-2 days)

### 1.1: Environment Configuration
- [x] Create `config/config.json` from the example file
- [x] Set up PostgreSQL database with appropriate credentials (using Supabase)
- [x] Create virtual environment and install dependencies from requirements.txt
- [x] Verify basic imports work without errors (fixed circular dependency issues)

### 1.2: Basic Structural Testing
- [x] Run existing unit tests to identify any immediate issues (found and fixed DI test issues)
- [x] Create a minimal test file that instantiates key components
- [x] Verify DI service registration works with core components (fixed DI tests)

**Deliverable**: Working development environment with validated configuration âœ…

## Phase 2: Core ETL Pipeline Validation (2-3 days)

### 2.1: Extractor Component
- [x] Test extractor with a small sample Skype export
- [x] Ensure file handling works for both JSON and TAR formats
- [x] Verify DI integration for content extraction

### 2.2: Transformer Component
- [ ] Test transformer with sample extracted data
- [ ] Verify message type handlers resolve correctly through DI
- [ ] Ensure transformer correctly processes different message types

### 2.3: Loader Component
- [ ] Validate database schema creation
- [ ] Test data loading with sample transformed data
- [ ] Verify database connections are managed properly

**Deliverable**: Validated ETL components working independently with proper DI

## Phase 3: Integration and MVP Creation (3-4 days)

### 3.1: Pipeline Integration
- [ ] Create a simple CLI wrapper script for the ETL pipeline
- [ ] Test the full ETL pipeline with a small real dataset
- [ ] Implement basic error handling and reporting

### 3.2: DI Framework Refinements
- [ ] Review message handler registration process
- [ ] Ensure singleton vs. transient services are correctly configured
- [ ] Add any missing protocol definitions for components

### 3.3: MVP Documentation
- [ ] Create a simple user guide for the MVP
- [ ] Document configuration options and requirements
- [ ] Add examples for common usage scenarios

**Deliverable**: Working end-to-end MVP with documentation

## Phase 4: Testing and Refinement (2-3 days)

### 4.1: Unit Testing
- [ ] Create/update unit tests for all key components
- [ ] Ensure DI-specific tests validate service resolution
- [ ] Test edge cases for message handling

### 4.2: Integration Testing
- [ ] Create integration tests for the full pipeline
- [ ] Test with various Skype export formats and sizes
- [ ] Validate database schema and data integrity

### 4.3: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Test parallel processing functionality
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for large datasets
- [ ] Implement and test checkpointing for resumable operations

**Deliverable**: Fully tested, optimized MVP with performance validation

## Phase 5: Advanced Features (Optional, 3-4 days)

### 5.1: Extended Message Type Support
- [ ] Implement handlers for additional message types
- [ ] Add support for attachments and media
- [ ] Enhance content extraction capabilities

### 5.2: Analysis and Reporting
- [ ] Implement basic reporting functionality
- [ ] Add data visualization options
- [ ] Create example queries for common analytics

### 5.3: User Interface Improvements
- [ ] Enhance CLI with additional options
- [ ] Add progress reporting and status updates
- [ ] Implement logging improvements

**Deliverable**: Enhanced MVP with advanced features

## Implementation Approach

### Technical Focus Areas

1. **Dependency Injection**:
   - Use constructor injection consistently
   - Leverage protocol-based interfaces for all components
   - Register services through the service registry

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement comprehensive error checking and validation
   - Provide clear error messages with context
   - Ensure clean recovery from common errors

3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Test each component in isolation with mock dependencies
   - Verify end-to-end functionality with integration tests
   - Include performance tests for large datasets

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Database Connectivity**:
   - Implement connection retries and pool management
   - Provide clear error messages for database issues
   - Add configuration validation

2. **Memory Management**:
   - Test with progressively larger datasets
   - Implement and verify garbage collection triggers
   - Monitor memory usage with the existing tools

3. **Parallel Processing**:
   - Start with single-threaded processing for simplicity
   - Add parallel processing as an optional enhancement
   - Test thread safety of shared components

## Getting Started

To begin implementation, I recommend:

1. Start with the configuration and setup phase
2. Create a small sample Skype export for testing
3. Focus on getting the basic ETL pipeline working
4. Add refinements and optimizations incrementally
