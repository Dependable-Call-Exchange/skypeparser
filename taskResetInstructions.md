# SkypeParser Development Context

## Task Overview & Current Status

### Core Problem/Feature
We've been enhancing the SkypeParser project with a comprehensive input validation system, with a recent focus on implementing strict path validation to prevent security vulnerabilities like path traversal attacks. This is critical for applications that handle user-provided file paths, especially in web contexts.

### Current Implementation Status
- ✅ Implemented a robust path validation system in `src/utils/validation.py`
- ✅ Updated all file-related validation functions to use the new path validation
- ✅ Added tests for the new validation functionality
- ✅ Updated documentation to reflect the changes
- ✅ All tests are passing

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Centralized Validation**: All validation logic is centralized in the `validation.py` module to ensure consistency and maintainability.
2. **Layered Validation Approach**: Basic validation functions (like `validate_path_safety`) are used by higher-level validation functions (like `validate_file_exists`).
3. **Configurable Security Controls**: Path validation includes configurable parameters for allowing/disallowing absolute paths and symbolic links.
4. **Base Directory Restriction**: Added ability to restrict file operations to a specific base directory.
5. **Exception-based Error Handling**: All validation functions raise a `ValidationError` exception with detailed error messages.

### Critical Constraints/Requirements
- Must prevent path traversal attacks
- Must support both relative and absolute paths (configurable)
- Must handle symbolic links safely
- Must work across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Must be backward compatible with existing code

   - **Role**: Example web application for the ETL pipeline
   - **Modifications**: Uses the validation functions but hasn't been directly modified
   - **Importance**: Shows how validation is used in a web context

### Dependencies and Configurations
- **Python Standard Library**: Uses `os`, `pathlib`, `re` for path manipulation and validation
- **Testing Framework**: Uses `unittest` for testing
- **No External Dependencies**: The validation system doesn't rely on any external packages

## Technical Context

### Technical Assumptions
- Paths are validated before any file operations
- The application has appropriate permissions to access the files and directories
- Path validation is used in conjunction with other security measures (like input sanitization)
- The application runs with the minimum necessary privileges

### External Services/APIs
- None for the validation system itself
- The validation system is used by the ETL pipeline which interacts with PostgreSQL

### Performance Considerations
- Path validation adds minimal overhead to file operations
- Path normalization and resolution can be expensive for deeply nested paths
- Validation is performed once per path, and the validated path is then used for all operations

### Security Considerations
- **Path Traversal Prevention**: The primary security concern addressed by the path validation system
- **Symbolic Link Handling**: Prevents accessing files outside the expected directory via symbolic links
- **Absolute Path Control**: Prevents accessing arbitrary files on the system
- **Base Directory Restriction**: Ensures all file operations are within a specified directory
- **Error Messages**: Detailed error messages for debugging, but care should be taken not to expose sensitive information to users

## Development Progress

### Last Completed Milestone
Successfully implemented strict path validation and updated all file-related validation functions to use it. All tests are passing, and documentation has been updated.

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Update the web example application to explicitly use the new path validation for user-uploaded files
2. Consider adding a file type whitelist/blacklist for additional security
3. Add validation for file content (e.g., checking for malicious content)
4. Implement rate limiting for file operations to prevent DoS attacks

### Known Issues/Technical Debt
- The path validation system doesn't handle URLs or remote file systems
- Some tests might be platform-specific (e.g., path comparison on macOS vs. Windows)
- The validation system doesn't handle file permissions beyond basic read/write access

### Attempted Approaches That Didn't Work
- Initially tried using simple string manipulation for path validation, but this was error-prone and didn't handle all edge cases
- Tried using `os.path` functions exclusively, but `pathlib` provides more robust path manipulation
- Initially didn't account for symbolic links on macOS in the tests, which caused test failures

## Developer Notes

### Codebase Structure Insights
- The validation module follows a pattern where basic validation functions are used by higher-level validation functions
- The ETL pipeline uses validation at each stage (extraction, transformation, loading)
- The web example application uses validation for user-uploaded files

### Workarounds/Temporary Solutions
- Using `Path.resolve()` in tests to handle symlinks on macOS
- Some validation functions still use `os.path` functions for backward compatibility

### Areas Needing Attention
- The path validation system should be tested on Windows to ensure cross-platform compatibility
- The web example application should be updated to use the new path validation explicitly
- Consider adding more comprehensive tests for edge cases (e.g., Unicode paths, very long paths)
- The validation system should be integrated with a logging system for better debugging

### Best Practices for Path Validation
1. Always validate user-provided paths
2. Use a base directory when possible
3. Avoid allowing absolute paths unless necessary
4. Disable symbolic links unless required
5. Handle validation errors gracefully with clear user feedback
