# Development Context: ETLContext Implementation and Modular ETL Pipeline

## Task Overview & Current Status

### Core Problem/Feature
We've implemented a shared context object (`ETLContext`) to manage state across the modular ETL pipeline components. This addresses the need for better coordination, state management, error handling, and telemetry across the Extract-Transform-Load process.

### Current Implementation Status
- ✅ Created `ETLContext` class with comprehensive state management capabilities
- ✅ Updated all ETL components (Extractor, Transformer, Loader, Pipeline Manager) to use the context
- ✅ Created unit tests for the ETLContext class
- ✅ Fixed import path issues in the modular components
- ✅ Created an example script demonstrating ETLContext usage
- ✅ Updated documentation to reflect the new implementation

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Shared Context Pattern**: Implemented a shared context object that's passed between components rather than using global state or complex parameter passing.
2. **Phase-Based Processing**: Structured the ETL process into distinct phases (extract, transform, load) with clear start/end boundaries.
3. **Centralized Telemetry**: Consolidated progress tracking, memory monitoring, and error recording in the context.
4. **Checkpointing Capability**: Added support for creating checkpoints after phases to enable resumable operations.
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained compatibility with the legacy ETL pipeline through a compatibility layer.

### Critical Constraints/Requirements
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing code
- Must support both synchronous and asynchronous processing
- Must handle large datasets efficiently with memory monitoring
- Must provide detailed telemetry for monitoring and debugging

### Dependencies and Configurations
- **psutil**: Required for memory monitoring in the ETLContext
- **PostgreSQL**: Required for the database operations in the Loader
- **Python 3.6+**: Required for type hints and other language features

## Technical Context

### Technical Assumptions
1. The ETL pipeline processes one file at a time
2. The ETL process is divided into three distinct phases: extract, transform, load
3. The database schema is already created and matches the expected structure
4. The ETL process may be memory-intensive for large datasets

### External Services/APIs
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Used for storing the processed data
- **File System**: Used for reading input files and optionally saving intermediate results

### Performance Considerations
1. **Memory Management**: The ETLContext includes memory monitoring to prevent out-of-memory errors
2. **Parallel Processing**: The Transformer supports parallel processing for large datasets
3. **Chunked Processing**: Messages are processed in chunks to reduce memory usage
4. **Batch Database Operations**: The Loader uses batch inserts for better database performance

### Security Considerations
1. **Database Credentials**: Stored in the ETLContext and passed to the Loader
2. **Input Validation**: The Extractor validates input files before processing
3. **Error Handling**: Errors are recorded in the ETLContext for later analysis

## Development Progress

### Last Completed Milestone
- Implemented the ETLContext class and updated all ETL components to use it
- Fixed import path issues in the modular components
- Created unit tests for the ETLContext class
- Created an example script demonstrating ETLContext usage
- Updated documentation to reflect the new implementation

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Implement integration tests for the modular ETL pipeline with ETLContext
2. Add support for resuming from checkpoints in the ETLPipeline class
3. Enhance error recovery mechanisms in the ETL components
4. Optimize memory usage further for very large datasets
5. Add more detailed telemetry for monitoring and debugging

### Known Issues/Technical Debt
1. The compatibility layer (`etl_pipeline_compat.py`) needs more comprehensive testing
2. Some error handling scenarios may not be fully covered
3. The memory monitoring could be more sophisticated (e.g., predicting memory usage)
4. Documentation for advanced usage scenarios could be improved

### Attempted Approaches That Didn't Work
1. **Global State Management**: Initially considered using global variables or a singleton for state management, but this created tight coupling and made testing difficult
2. **Parameter Passing**: Tried passing state through method parameters, but this became unwieldy with many parameters
3. **Event-Based Communication**: Considered an event system for component communication, but this added complexity without clear benefits

## Developer Notes

### Codebase Structure Insights
1. The modular ETL pipeline follows a clear separation of concerns with distinct components for each phase
2. The ETLContext serves as a central hub for state management, reducing coupling between components
3. The compatibility layer allows for a gradual transition from the legacy pipeline to the modular approach

### Workarounds/Temporary Solutions
1. The import path issues were fixed by changing relative imports to absolute imports, but a more consistent import strategy could be implemented
2. The memory monitoring currently uses a simple threshold approach, but could be enhanced with more sophisticated algorithms

### Areas Needing Attention
1. **Error Recovery**: The error handling and recovery mechanisms need further development
2. **Checkpoint Resumption**: The ability to resume from checkpoints needs to be fully implemented
3. **Performance Testing**: More comprehensive performance testing with large datasets is needed
4. **Documentation**: The documentation should be expanded to cover more advanced usage scenarios
5. **API Integration**: The integration with the API layer needs to be updated to use the new ETLContext

### Testing Considerations
1. Unit tests for the ETLContext are in place, but integration tests are needed
2. Performance tests should be updated to use the ETLContext
3. Edge cases like memory limits and error scenarios need more thorough testing
