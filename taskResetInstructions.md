# SkypeParser Development Context Summary

## Task Overview & Current Status

### Core Problem/Feature
The SkypeParser project is being enhanced with a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for processing Skype chat exports. The current focus is on fixing unit tests for the ETL pipeline to ensure proper validation, mocking, and error handling.

### Current Implementation Status
- The ETL pipeline core functionality is implemented
- Input validation has been added throughout the codebase
- Path safety validation has been implemented
- Unit tests are being fixed to properly mock dependencies and validate functionality
- Several tests are failing due to issues with mocking the validation functions

### Key Architectural Decisions
- Separation of concerns: Extraction, transformation, and loading phases are distinct
- Validation module created to centralize input validation logic
- Path safety validation to prevent directory traversal and other security issues
- Comprehensive unit testing with proper mocking of dependencies

### Critical Constraints/Requirements
- Must handle both JSON and TAR file formats
- Must validate file paths for security
- Must properly handle database connections and transactions
- Tests must run without requiring actual files or database connections

## Codebase Navigation

### Key Files (Ranked by Importance)

1. **src/db/etl_pipeline.py**
   - Core ETL pipeline implementation
   - Contains extract, transform, and load methods
   - Handles file processing, data transformation, and database operations
   - Recent modifications include integration with validation module

2. **src/utils/validation.py**
   - Central validation module
   - Implements file existence, path safety, and data structure validation
   - Recently enhanced with strict path validation to prevent security issues

3. **tests/test_etl_pipeline.py**
   - Unit tests for ETL pipeline
   - Currently being fixed to properly mock dependencies
   - Tests all aspects of the pipeline including error handling

4. **src/utils/file_handler.py**
   - Handles file operations for different formats
   - Contains functions for reading JSON and TAR files
   - Used by the ETL pipeline for data extraction

5. **src/utils/config.py**
   - Configuration management
   - Loads database and application settings
   - Provides configuration for message types and other parameters

### Important Dependencies/Configurations
- PostgreSQL database for data storage
- psycopg2 for database connectivity
- JSON and tarfile modules for file processing
- unittest and mock for testing

## Technical Context

### Non-obvious Technical Assumptions
- File paths in tests are relative to the workspace root
- Database connection is expected to be available but is mocked in tests
- Validation functions are called from multiple places, requiring careful mocking
- The ETL pipeline assumes specific JSON structure for Skype exports

### External Services/APIs
- PostgreSQL database for data storage
- No external web APIs are currently used

### Performance Considerations
- Large file handling is optimized through streaming where possible
- Database operations use transactions for atomicity
- Error handling includes proper cleanup of resources

### Security Considerations
- Path validation prevents directory traversal attacks
- Input validation ensures data integrity
- Database queries use parameterized statements to prevent SQL injection
- File operations validate file types and content

## Development Progress

### Last Completed Milestone
- Implementation of path safety validation
- Integration of validation throughout the codebase
- Fixing the `test_load` method to properly mock database operations

### Immediate Next Steps
- Fix remaining failing tests in `test_etl_pipeline.py`
- Properly mock `validate_file_exists` in validation module
- Update patch paths in test methods to target the correct modules
- Ensure all tests run without requiring actual files

### Known Issues/Technical Debt
- Some tests are failing due to incorrect mock setups
- Path validation in tests needs to be properly mocked
- Database connection errors in tests need to be addressed
- Warning about invalid output directories needs investigation

### Attempted Approaches That Didn't Work
- Patching only the ETL pipeline's validation functions without patching the underlying validation module
- Using simple return values for mocks instead of proper mock objects with configured methods
- Inconsistent patch paths across different test methods

## Developer Notes

### Non-obvious Codebase Insights
- The validation module is used both directly and indirectly through other modules
- The ETL pipeline has multiple layers of validation (file existence, format, content)
- Test setup is complex due to the need to mock multiple dependencies
- The pipeline handles both file paths and file objects with different validation paths

### Workarounds/Temporary Solutions
- Some tests are using direct patching of internal functions rather than public interfaces
- Mock setups are sometimes duplicated across test methods
- File paths in tests are hardcoded rather than using temporary files

### Areas Needing Careful Handling
- Validation mocking in tests requires attention to the correct patch paths
- Database connection and transaction handling needs careful testing
- Error handling and cleanup in the ETL pipeline is critical
- File path validation needs to be consistently applied and tested
