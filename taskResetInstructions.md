# Skype Parser ETL Pipeline Development Context

## Task Overview & Current Status

### Core Problem
The Skype Parser ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline is experiencing several interface and implementation inconsistencies that prevent successful execution of the full pipeline. While individual components (extractor, transformer, loader) have been validated independently, integration issues arise when running the complete pipeline, particularly with message type handling and database operations.

### Current Implementation Status
- **Completed**: Basic configuration, environment setup, and individual component testing
- **In Progress**: Integration of ETL components into a functioning pipeline
- **Blocked**: Full pipeline execution due to interface mismatches and implementation gaps

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Dependency Injection Framework**: Using a custom DI framework for component registration and resolution, enabling testability and modularity
2. **Protocol-Based Interfaces**: Leveraging Python's Protocol classes to define component interfaces
3. **Modular ETL Pipeline**: Separating extraction, transformation, and loading into distinct components
4. **PostgreSQL Database**: Using PostgreSQL (via Supabase) for data storage

### Critical Constraints
1. **Test Organization**: Tests must be properly organized in the designated directories (unit vs. integration)
2. **Interface Consistency**: All components must adhere to their defined interfaces
3. **Database Schema**: Operations must use the correct schema namespace (public)
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling is required for production readiness

### Key Files (Ranked by Importance)

1. **`src/db/etl/pipeline_manager.py`**
   - **Role**: Orchestrates the ETL process
   - **Modifications**: Needs updates to ensure proper context initialization with user_id and export_date

2. **`src/utils/interfaces.py`**
   - **Role**: Defines protocol interfaces for all components
   - **Modifications**: Method name in MessageHandlerFactoryProtocol needs to be changed from `get_handler_for_message_type` to `get_handler` to match implementation

3. **`src/db/etl/loader.py`**
   - **Role**: Handles loading transformed data into the database
   - **Modifications**: Needs updates to use `execute_values` instead of `execute_many` for batch operations and proper handling of null timestamps

4. **`src/db/connection.py`**
   - **Role**: Manages database connections
   - **Modifications**: Needs an `execute` method that calls `execute_query` to match interface expectations

5. **`src/parser/content_extractor.py`**
   - **Role**: Extracts and cleans content from messages
   - **Modifications**: Missing `extract_cleaned_content` method needs to be implemented

6. **`src/db/etl/context.py`**
   - **Role**: Maintains context for the ETL process
   - **Modifications**: Needs proper initialization of user_id and export_date attributes

7. **`src/utils/service_registry.py`**
   - **Role**: Manages service registration for dependency injection
   - **Modifications**: Message handler factory registration needs correction

8. **`src/utils/message_type_handlers.py`**
   - **Role**: Contains handlers for different message types
   - **Modifications**: Implementation of `get_handler` method needs to be verified

9. **`src/db/etl/transformer.py`**
   - **Role**: Transforms extracted data into a format suitable for loading
   - **Modifications**: Needs to properly use the content extractor

10. **`src/db/etl/extractor.py`**
    - **Role**: Extracts data from Skype export files
    - **Status**: Functioning correctly

### Important Dependencies
- **psycopg2**: PostgreSQL database adapter
- **pytest**: Testing framework
- **logging**: Logging framework

## Technical Context

### Technical Assumptions
1. The ETL pipeline processes one Skype export at a time
2. Database tables are created if they don't exist during the loading phase
3. The service registry correctly resolves dependencies for most components
4. The content extractor can handle various HTML formats in Skype messages

### External Services
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Used for storing processed Skype data
- **Supabase**: Hosting the PostgreSQL database

### Performance Considerations
1. Batch database operations are used for efficient data loading
2. Memory usage optimization is needed for large datasets
3. Checkpointing mechanism allows for resumable operations

### Security Considerations
1. Database credentials are stored in configuration files
2. User data from Skype exports contains personal information

## Development Progress

### Last Completed Milestone
- Individual component testing (extractor, transformer, loader)
- CLI wrapper script creation for the ETL pipeline

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Standardize interface definitions in `src/utils/interfaces.py`
2. Fix method name mismatches between interfaces and implementations
3. Implement missing methods in `ContentExtractor` class
4. Add `execute` method to `DatabaseConnection` class
5. Update database batch operations to use appropriate methods for PostgreSQL

### Known Issues
1. Interface-implementation mismatch in `MessageHandlerFactoryProtocol`
2. Missing `extract_cleaned_content` method in `ContentExtractor`
3. Missing `execute` method in `DatabaseConnection`
4. Incorrect batch operation method (`execute_many` vs. `execute_values`)
5. Improper context initialization for user_id and export_date
6. Null timestamp handling in database operations

### Attempted Approaches That Failed
1. Direct use of `execute_batch` for multi-placeholder queries (PostgreSQL limitation)
2. Relying on default values for user_id in database (violates not-null constraint)
3. Using function registration instead of class registration for message handler factory

## Developer Notes

### Codebase Structure Insights
1. The project follows a clear separation between protocols (interfaces) and implementations
2. Test organization is critical - unit tests and integration tests are strictly separated
3. The dependency injection framework is custom-built and requires careful service registration
4. Database operations are abstracted through connection adapters

### Temporary Solutions
1. Custom `DatabaseConnectionAdapter` used in tests to bridge interface differences
2. Default values for user_id and export_date in the loader to prevent null constraint violations

### Areas Needing Attention
1. Interface consistency across all components
2. Proper error handling and reporting
3. Database schema namespace usage
4. Batch operation efficiency for large datasets
5. Context state management throughout the pipeline

### Implementation Strategy
The recommended approach is test-driven refactoring:
1. Start with interface standardization
2. Update unit tests to verify implementations
3. Fix core ETL component issues
4. Integrate and test the full pipeline

This approach ensures that changes are properly tested and validated before integration, reducing the risk of regression issues.
